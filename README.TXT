PROJECT TITLE: Top Down Race
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To make a fun and enjoyable game that can be played with 1 or 2 players
VERSION or DATE: V1.0, completed 06/16/17
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Press the "Run" button, then click either 1 or 2 players to start
AUTHORS: Connor Brunt, Madison Skorbinski, Madeline Thompson
USER INSTRUCTIONS: When you first play the game, the 1 player option will bring you to a store and the two player option brings you straight to the game.
In 1 player mode, the car is controlled using the WASD keys, and in 2 player, the second car is controlled with IJKL. After the game, you can use your points from singleplayer to
buy a car to use the next round. High scores are logged at the end, and if you want to clear them, look for "highscores.txt" in the project folder, and delete the information in it.
Powerups that give extra points will spawn periodically along with bombs that will destroy your car if you hit them. Going completely off the track will also destroy your car, and in a 2 player game
the round doesn't end until both cars are destroyed.
