Testing Summary:

While many, many different quick test were performed throughout the development process, the following are the main test cases we used at the end

1. 1 Player, hits a bomb and dies
2. 1 Player, goes off track and dies
3. 1 Player, collects a powerup then hits a bomb and dies
4. 2 Player, see above scenarios
5. 1 Player buys a new car after earning enough points
6. 1 Player goes back to start screen then tries to buy a new car
7. 2 player but then user goes back to one player to buy a car

Based on the success of these test cases and a thorough look-through of our code, we determined that our game was working properly and without bugs
